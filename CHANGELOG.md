# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The **wire protocol** version is tracked separately from the library version — it
is a distinct compatibility contract for agent/client implementers. Current wire
protocol version: **1**.

## [Unreleased]

_Becomes `0.7.0` at the first tag._

### Added

- Initial public release of RemoteBLE — a Kotlin Multiplatform "remote mode" for
  [Kable](https://github.com/JuulLabs/kable). App code written against Kable's
  `Peripheral`/`Scanner` runs unchanged whether the radio is local or driven by a
  remote **agent** over a WebSocket (CBOR-framed protocol).
- `:client-sdk` — transport → session → GATT/scan ops → Kable adapters. Targets
  JVM (tests), Android, iOS. Published to Maven Central as
  `dev.warsha.remoteble:client-sdk`.
- `:protocol` — the wire contract (`Frame`/`Op`/`OpResult`/`AgentEvent`) + CBOR/JSON
  codec. Published as `dev.warsha.remoteble:protocol`.
- `:agent` — the remote Bluetooth agent (WebSocket server, op handler, Kable radio
  engine, live status dashboard) on JVM/Android/iOS.
- `agent-rs` — a second, independent agent implementation in Rust (tokio,
  `btleplug`), interop-verified byte-for-byte against the Kotlin codec.
- Full GATT surface over the wire: scan, connect, discover, read, write,
  observe/notify, MTU, plus capability-gated descriptors, pairing, connection
  priority, batched scan, and connection-slot telemetry.
- Peripheral ownership/leasing, reconcile-on-reconnect, and independent IP-vs-BLE
  connection state machines.
- A normative, language-agnostic conformance spec
  ([docs/agent-proxy-spec.md](docs/agent-proxy-spec.md)).
